---

## 6. Critical Findings

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Proper Localization**: Project is fully contained within its directory
2. **No Cross-Directory Dependencies**: All references are local
3. **Complete Migration Set**: All required database migrations present
4. **Proper Environment Setup**: Supabase credentials configured
5. **Correct Technology Stack**: All required dependencies installed

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention
1. **Evidence Pack Implementation**: Structure defined but needs full implementation
2. **AI Processing Pipeline**: Edge functions need to be completed
3. **Evidence Binding Logic**: Frontend binding to photos/transcripts needed
4. **Consent Management UI**: User consent flow needs implementation
5. **Testing Coverage**: No test results available yet

### 🚨 Immediate Action Items
1. Complete Evidence Pack workflows in frontend
2. Implement AI processing edge functions
3. Add consent management flow
4. Set up testing suite for acceptance criteria
5. Implement evidence binding UI components

---

## 7. Deployment Readiness

| Component | Ready | Blocking Issues |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Database Schema | ✅ | None |
| Frontend Build | ✅ | None |
| Mobile Config | ✅ | None |
| Edge Functions | ⚠️ | AI processing implementation |
| Storage | ✅ | None |
| Authentication | ⚠️ | Auth flow not visible |
| Testing | ❌ | Test suite not implemented |

**Overall Readiness**: 60% - Core infrastructure ready, implementation gaps remain

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Implement Evidence Pack selection and workflow UI
2. Complete AI processing edge functions
3. Add consent management flow with geolocation
4. Implement evidence binding to estimate lines

### Short-term (Week 2-3)
1. Add comprehensive testing suite
2. Implement share link generation and expiry
3. Complete offline sync queue management
4. Add telemetry and monitoring

### Pre-Production
1. Load testing with 100 concurrent visits
2. Security audit of RLS policies
3. Performance optimization for p95 <60s processing
4. GDPR compliance verification

---

## Conclusion

The ScopeKit v1.2 project is properly localized and has a solid foundation matching the PRP requirements. The database schema, frontend structure, and infrastructure configuration are well-aligned with specifications. However, several key features need implementation before the system is production-ready, particularly around Evidence Packs, AI processing, and consent management.

**Audit Result**: **PASS WITH CONDITIONS** - Project structure is correct and localized, but requires completion of identified implementation gaps.
